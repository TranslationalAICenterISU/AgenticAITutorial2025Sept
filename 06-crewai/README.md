# Module 6: CrewAI - Multi-Agent Collaboration

## Overview
Learn CrewAI, a powerful framework for building collaborative multi-agent systems where AI agents work together as a team.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand CrewAI's multi-agent architecture
- Create specialized agents with distinct roles
- Design collaborative workflows and processes
- Implement delegation and communication between agents

## Topics Covered

### 1. CrewAI Fundamentals
- Multi-agent system concepts
- Agent roles and responsibilities
- Crew composition and hierarchy
- Installation and setup

### 2. Agent Creation and Configuration
- Defining agent roles and goals
- Agent backstories and personalities
- Tool assignment and capabilities
- Agent communication protocols

### 3. Tasks and Workflows
- Task definition and assignment
- Sequential vs parallel execution
- Task dependencies and prerequisites
- Output formatting and validation

### 4. Tools and Integration
- Built-in CrewAI tools
- Custom tool development
- Tool sharing between agents
- External API integrations

### 5. Crew Management
- Crew composition strategies
- Agent delegation and collaboration
- Process optimization
- Performance monitoring

### 6. Advanced Patterns
- Hierarchical agent structures
- Consensus building mechanisms
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Dynamic crew formation

## Hands-On Activities
