# Hands-On Agentic AI Workshop

A comprehensive 2-day workshop covering Agentic AI concepts and practical implementations using leading frameworks.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop provides hands-on experience with Agentic AI systems, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementations using popular frameworks including OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, LangGraph, Google ADK, CrewAI, SmolAgents, DSPy, Parlant, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and local model deployments (Ollama, HuggingFace).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with APIs and HTTP requests
- API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic (instructions provided)
