## Hands-On Activities
1. **Framework Bake-off**: Compare same task across frameworks
2. **Hybrid Architecture**: Build system using 3+ frameworks
3. **Production Pipeline**: Deploy integrated agent system
4. **Performance Analysis**: Benchmark and optimize integrated system

- **SmolAgents**: Lightweight task execution
- **Shared Memory**: Cross-framework state management

## Best Practices

### 1. Framework Selection
- Start simple, evolve complexity
- Consider long-term maintenance
- Evaluate team expertise
- Plan for scaling needs

### 2. Integration Design
- Loose coupling between components
- Clear API boundaries
- Shared standards for data formats
- Centralized configuration management

### 3. Production Readiness
- Comprehensive error handling
- Monitoring and alerting
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization

### 4. Team Organization
- Framework expertise distribution
- Code review processes
- Documentation standards
- Training and knowledge sharing

## Prerequisites
- Completed all previous modules
- Understanding of system architecture
- Production deployment experience helpful

## Final Project
Build a complete agentic system that integrates at least 3 different frameworks to solve a real-world problem, demonstrating best practices in architecture, monitoring, and deployment.
