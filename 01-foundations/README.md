# Module 1: Agentic AI Foundations

## Overview
This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Agentic AI, providing the theoretical foundation for building autonomous AI systems.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what makes AI "agentic"
- Learn key architectural patterns
- Explore agent types and capabilities
- Understand the role of LLMs in agent systems

## Topics Covered

### 1. What is Agentic AI?
- Definition and core characteristics
- Autonomy vs automation
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Decision-making capabilities

### 2. Agent Architecture Patterns
- ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)
- Planning and execution cycles
- Memory systems
- Tool usage patterns

### 3. Types of AI Agents
- Simple reflex agents
- Goal-based agents
- Utility-based agents
- Learning agents
- Multi-agent systems

### 4. Key Components
- Planning and reasoning
- Memory management
- Tool integration
- Feedback loops
- Error handling

### 5. LLMs as Agent Brains
- Prompt engineering for agents
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Function calling capabilities
- Context management

## Hands-On Activities
1. **Agent Behavior Analysis**: Analyze different agent behaviors
2. **Simple Agent Design**: Design a basic agent architecture
3. **ReAct Pattern Implementation**: Build a simple ReAct loop
